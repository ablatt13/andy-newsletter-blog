    <section class="newsletter">
        <p>Hey y&#39all!</p>
        <p>Welcome back to another addition of my newsletter!</p>
        <p>Last week started off with a really memorable event! Some of the show lighting people from Tokyo, Shanghai,
            and Hong Kong came to visit so we went on a nighttime park walk with them. We visited Toontown and rode
            Mickey and Minnie&#39s Runaway Railway which is always fun. Our leader, Noah, worked on the attraction so he
            was pointing out all of the lighting fixtures and talked about his experiences focusing some of the display
            lights. We were also able to visit Star Wars: Galaxy&#39s Edge when it was closing, so there were barely any
            people. It&#39s such a beautiful land at night. We got to learn about some fun easter eggs like how the
            lighting designer programmed a specific red blinking light in the land to have a slower third blink as a nod
            to when he did that with his Cars Land design. It was such a clear night and I got this beautiful photo of
            the beams of light (that were over 100ft away from the rockwork they were lighting up) on top of one of the
            building rooftops.</p>
        <div class="pics">
            <img src="images/Starwars.jpg" loading="lazy">
        </div>
        <p>I also got to work on a mock-up to test some acrylic samples to see which diffused light best. I was working
            with 1/2" foamcore and some gaff tape. If Christianne (one of my college professors) saw the lightbox
            she&#39d probably grade it a 2 out of 3 because the front had a lot of fingerprints on it but the window
            cuts were pretty clean considering the dull box cutter I was using (shout out to the water color squares
            freshman year). Rocco and I also got to program the lights in the box to do a simple effect which was fun.
        </p>
        <p>On top of the lightbox mock-up I did, I also worked on a larger scale mock-up with Rocco where we actually
            got to set up lights and focus them at specific parts of hanging scenery. We&#39ve got everything set up but
            still need to program the effects with the designer, so I&#39m excited to see it all come together.</p>
        <p>Whenever I use my employee ID at Disneyland, I get asked "Where do you make magic?" which really
            means <i>Where do you work?</i> I visited Disneyland on Sunday with a few friends that were visiting for
            spring break and told them about this occurrence because I think it&#39s a fun little thing that you
            wouldn&#39t know if you weren&#39t employed by the company. When I purchased something in Star Wars:
            Galaxy&#39s Edge, however, I was asked "Where do you earn your credits?" which completely stumped me for a
            moment. I love that all of the language in Galaxy&#39s Edge is themed, including questions to other Cast
            Members (employees).</p>
        <p>I&#39ve also been working on paperwork for various projects that had deadlines this past Thursday. This
            included running reports and downloading PDFs with proper page breaks and dates on them. It&#39s not
            glorious work by any means, but it helps give the designers a few hours back in their day to focus on other
            things so I&#39m always happy to help.</p>
        <p>On Thursday I went to my first meeting alone to take notes for my leader because he was double booked. It was
            a little nerve wracking because I needed to make sure I got accurate information back to my leader, but it
            was also pretty cool to be an intern alone in a room full of full-time adults.</p>
        <p>Lastly, today I got a big project doing photometrics for an attraction. Photometrics are what lighting
            designers use to determine the beam angle and positioning (among other things) for all of the lights they
            decide to use. I got through six scenes in about five hours, and still have two more scenes to finish up on
            Monday. Attractions are broken down by scenes, similar to scenes in a play/musical, where each scene is
            essentially each room/area in that attraction/ride. I&#39m excited that my workload is picking up and I get
            to practice skills I&#39ve learned in high school and college in new ways and on new computer programs (like
            Revit and Navisworks).</p>
        <p>That&#39s all I have for the past two weeks. I&#39m loving my time here and can&#39t wait to see what else I
            get to do in the next few months!</p>
        <p>Feel free to reach out with questions; I&#39ll try to answer them the best I can!</p>

    <section class="newsletter">
        <p>Hey y&#39all!</p>
        <p>I&#39m officially done with one month of my internship! I&#39ve learned so much and can&#39t wait to learn
            even more with the rest of my time here.</p>
        <p>Last week was super eventful! As a Show Lighting group, we tuned in to watch the Imaginations presentations
            the finalists were giving. The Imaginations competition is for college students to compete by creating a
            solution to the problem posed by the competition (this year was transportation) and solve it in an
            Imagineering type of way by adding a story and theme to it. Some of the lighting leaders interviewed one of
            the finalists, so we tuned in to watch and support her group. I thought it was very sweet that after a
            thirty minute conversation, we all decided to support and cheer her on.</p>
        <p>I also got to see some mock-ups for projects that I&#39m not working on. These were on a much larger scale
            than the mock-ups I was working on in previous weeks. Both of these included sets that were at least 20 feet
            tall with projections covering all of the walls. The mock-up I went to last Tuesday also had a scale ride
            vehicle made out of plywood and carved foam and a projected ride path on the floor that you could walk to
            see how the projections interact with the 3D video projected on the walls. It&#39s really cool to see how
            in-depth they make their mock-ups when needed. It&#39s worth it to them to spend the money doing the
            mock-ups because if something doesn&#39t work, it&#39s cheaper and easier to change something now instead of
            when the ride is fully built.</p>
        <p>I also got to do some paperwork this past week. I worked on correcting some title blocks for the lighting
            documents of an attraction. I also got to go through 1,000+ lights and make sure that everything listed on
            the lighting schedule was plotted. This took me about six and a half hours but it&#39s probably been my
            favorite task so far. It was really helpful both to the designer and to me because I was able to learn more
            about how and where lights go for the outside (what&#39s called Area Development) and to fully realize how
            many lights go into an area or an attraction. Later I learned that the roof of the attraction has about
            4,000 lights on it. Just for the roof! I can&#39t wait to see it when it&#39s complete in a few years.</p>
        <p>This week I&#39ve been attending more meetings and have worked on some more mock-ups. I even got to wire some
            things together and got to use my electrical skills I learned in the Prop Shop!</p>
        <p>When I was walking to work on Wednesday I saw a raccoon so of course I had to snap a photo!</p>

        <p>I went to Disneyland last weekend (shocker, I know) and got this photo of San Fransokyo Square (based on Big
            Hero 6) in Disney California Adventure. The water was so still that I love looking at the reflection of the
            bridge in the water.</p>

    <section class="newsletter">
        <p>Hi everyone!</p>
        <p>Here&#39s a photo from visiting Disneyland two weeks ago. The guy on the left of Mickey is Rocco and on the
            right is Jacob. They&#39re the two other lighting interns!</p>
        <div class="pics">
            <img src="images/LightingInterns.jpg" loading="lazy">
        </div>
        <p>Last week I wrote and edited some light fixture specification sheets, basically describing what the functions
            of the light are and what other parts it comes with when it&#39s ordered (like a safety cable or C-clamp for
            example). I also marked-up a document notating where the lights should be installed on a statue-like figure.
            I&#39ve also been attending meetings for the two projects I&#39m working on.</p>
        <p>Last Friday was Traditions which is something everyone who gets hired at the company has to do. It&#39s
            basically a training to teach you about the company and resources available to you. Here I got an awesome
            Mickey hat that&#39s now at my desk and a new name tag! The name tags typically have hometowns on it, so we
            don&#39t know why they say Anaheim.</p>
        <div class="pics">
            <img src="images/TraditionsSwag.jpg" loading="lazy">
        </div>
        <p>Traditions was held in a building next to the parks so after we were done with training we all went to the
            parks and hung out! It was great to meet some other new interns who we normally wouldn&#39t see.</p>
        <p>This week I spent a lot of time learning about the various programs the Show Lighting team uses including
            Revit, AutoCAD, Navisworks, and Mosaic. I watched a lot of the Mosaic tutorials and tested some stuff out on
            the actual program, so that was pretty cool. The past two days I also worked on some lighting mock-ups for
            the projects I&#39m working on. One mock-up was to add some lights and focus them towards some white boards
            to get backlighting for a projection test, and the other was setting up some lights under a custom-made
            board to shoot light up through it. I&#39ve also been going to more meetings and have recently been
            proof-reading documents because the deadline for the project is coming up.</p>
        <p>This weekend I&#39m going to Disneyland again on Saturday and on Sunday we&#39re getting a group together to
            go to the Rose Bowl Flea Market.</p>
        <p>Talk to you all soon!</p>

    <h2 id="NewsOne" class="subliner">Newsletter 1 -- 1/21-1/26</h2>
    <section class="newsletter">
        <p>Hi!</p>
        <p>Welcome to my newsletter!</p>
        <p>For those of you who don&#39t know: I am taking a gap semester from the University of Michigan to work at
            Walt Disney Imagineering (WDI) as a Show Lighting Design intern! Working for Disney, and specifically
            Imagineering, has been a dream of mine for the past 10 years since researching Walt Disney for a 4th
            grade project.</p>
        <p>My first week has been off to an amazing start! Tuesday was an Imagineering Orientation day where we learned
            all about the company and got to see and experience some very cool things! At the orientation I got my name
            tag, my ID (not pictured) and ID holder, a notebook, and a flyer from the opening of Star Wars Galaxy&#39s
            Edge in Florida. My cubicle also had a sign with welcome notes from everyone in the lighting department and
            it makes me smile every time I walk to my desk.</p>
        <div class="pics">
            <img src="images/Swag.jpg" loading="lazy">
            <img src="images/Welcome.jpg" loading="lazy">
        </div>
        <p>On Wednesday, the other interns and I tagged along with my leader to three different meetings about various
            projects. It was great to see how they worked and learn a little bit more about what a Show Lighting
            Designer does. At the last meeting I went to, they had some pastries from Porto&#39s and they were
            delicious!</p>
        <p>Thursday we learned about the lighting database (lots of Excel sheets) that contain all of the show lighting
            information for each attraction. One of the other interns and I started to reorganize all of the binders
            that have the paperwork for each attraction, even the ones that are no longer at the parks. The oldest one
            we&#39ve found is from 1981 (pre-Excel), but we&#39re only about half-way through (about 300 binders and
            counting!). It&#39s a great project because I&#39m familiarizing myself with all of the attractions.</p>
        <p>Today we finished cataloguing the binders and started physically reorganizing them. There were 709 total
            binders! Near the end of the day today I was given my project assignment and am excited to start working on
            it on Monday!</p>
        <p>Tomorrow, we (the other two lighting interns and I) are going to visit the parks and check everything out.
            I&#39m super excited to see Disney California Adventure since I&#39ve never been, and to return back to
            Disneyland and see it without its holiday theme.</p>
        <p>I&#39m so excited for everything I am going to learn and experience during this internship. This truly is a
            dream come true for me.</p>
        <p>My plan is to send out updates every other week just as some short updates as to what I&#39m doing.</p>
        <p>Talk to you all soon!</p>
